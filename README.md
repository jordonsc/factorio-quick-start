Factorio Quick Start Booster
============================
Speed up a second play by starting with high-speed robots and a quick-start inventory.  

This is for people who have completed the game and want to start a new world, but suddenly remembered how slow it is
manually constructing a base with burner inserters.

You gain the annoying/tedious things that take time to rebuild, while keeping the essence of the game in-tact.


Included
--------
On player creation (game start) you get:

* Research completed:
  * All bot speed
  * All bot carry capacity
  * Tool bet size enhancement
  * Logistic & trash slots
* Armour:
  * Power Armor MkII
  * 2x MkII roboports
  * 2x exoskeletons 
  * 2x fusion reactors
  * 150 construction bots
* Items:
  * A bunch of fast belts & inserters
  * Factories, furnaces and enough kit to set up a power station
  * A handful of base resources (iron, copper, gears, green chips)
  * A couple cars loaded with more of the above

You should be able to set up a small base and get on your feet, but no additional research is granted.

Installing
----------
Build the mod by running `./build.sh`, then copy the zip file created in `build/` to your mods directory in 
`~/.factorio/mods` (Linux) or `AppData\Roaming\Factorio\mods` (Windows). On Linux, for your current user, you can 
run `./build.sh && ./install.sh` to quickly build and copy the mod.


Credit
------
This is a quick port of the `Pasukaru/factorio-quick-start` mod - all credit there, I just hacked it apart to suit what
I was looking for in a quick-start.
